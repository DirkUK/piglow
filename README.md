# Getting Started with PiGlow

You may have a funky LED board for your Raspberry Pi called a PiGlow.

This project gives you the opportunity to put your PiGlow to good work by programming it using Python. First, you will need to set up your Raspberry Pi by configuring some files and downloading some modules. Then you can start to make individual LEDs blink, before getting them to pulse in pretty ways for displays! (Ooh, that rhymed!)
